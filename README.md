Oh baby baby
Have you seen Amy tonight
Is she in the bathroom
Is she smokin' up outside
Oh baby baby
Does she take a piece of lime
For the drink
that Imma buy her
Do you know just
what she likes
Tell me have you seen her
'Cause I'm so
I can't get her off
of my brain
I just want to go to the party
she gon' go
Can somebody take me home
Haha hehe haha ho
Love me hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and
all of the girls are beggin'
to If You Seek Amy
Love me hate me
But can't you see
what I see
All of the boys and
all of the girls are
beggin' to If You Seek Amy
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
Amy told me that
she's gonna meet me up
I don't know where or when
and now they're
closing up the club
I've seen her once or twice
before she knows my face
But it's hard to see
with all the people
standing in the way
Tell me have you seen her
'Cause I'm so
I can't get her off
of my brain
I just want to go to the party
she's gonna go
Can somebody take me home
Haha hehe haha ho
Love me hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and
all of the girls are beggin'
to If You Seek Amy
Love me hate me
But can't you see
what I see
All of the boys and all
of the girls are beggin'
to If You Seek Amy
Say what you want about me
But can't you see
what I see
Say what you want about me
So tell me if you've seen her
let me know
what she was wearing and
what she was like
Cause I've been
waiting here forever
let me know
where she was going
I don't mind
Oh baby baby
If You Seek Amy tonight
Oh baby baby
We'll do whatever you like
Oh baby baby baby
Oh baby baby baby
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
la la la la la la la la
Love me hate me
Say what you want about me
But all of the boys and
all of the girls are beggin'
to If You Seek Amy
Love me hate me
But can't you seek
what I see
All of the boys and
all of the girls are begging
to If You Seek Amy
Love me hate me
Say what you want about me
Love me hate me
But can't you see
what I see
All of the boys and
all of the girls are beggin'
to If You Seek Amy
love me hate me
Say what you want about me
But can't you see
what I see
love me hate me
Oh Say what you want about me
All of the boys and
all of the girls are beggin'
to If You Seek Amy
